      <h1> Artist Statement </h1>
      <p id=#e03> I create video art aimed toward informing or entertaining purposes.
        I use toys and stuffed animals to give them their own personality
        to enhance the possibilties of surprises and laughter.
        My entertainment videos also have indirect messages to the viewer.
        For example, one of my videos indirectly shows that running
        during Halloween night may be dangerous if someone isn't paying attention.
        Using comedy to enhance a viewer's will to remember the lesson in <thead>
          video is what I try to achieve in my entertainment videos.

        <h3> <b> The Process </b> </h3>

        The process I go through with my entertainment videos is that I quickly brainstorm
        the story idea. Once I planned out the entire story, I begin creating props,
        building the scenery, and recording the footage. Afterward, I edit using
        premiere pro and lastly upload to my website. I try to use props that
        relate to the theme of a video as much as possible. In my third project,
        I used tigger because he was a prop I could use to easily resemble halloween
        and switching costumes. Using tigger also helps connect to the viewer because
        tigger is very popular and many people know this Disney character. Therefore, many
        people find it funny when they see tigger doing something silly. Using props
        that people can relate to help build laughter which promotes memorization of my
        videos and the hidden lessons within my videos.
